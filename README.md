## What is cyberjūtsu ?

Cyberjūtsu is a new way to teach cybersecurity inspired from martial arts trainings. It is an educational way which allows everyone (novice to expert) to practice together and improve themselves in cybersecurity through confrontation. It follows budō (judo, jujitsu, karate...) principles and ethical code. The goal is to reach "maximum-efficient use of computer" in a "mutual benefit" of a human confrontation.


## Why do we apply martial arts to cybersecurity?

Improve coordination between mind and movements. Train to act in stressing situations. Develop fast and accurate reflexes. Learn to improvise in unfamiliar events. Teach a code of conduct. Learn to respect others. There are plenty of other reasons.
