## French Translation of 'What is cyberjūtsu ?'

Cyberjūtsu is a new way to teach cybersecurity inspired from modern japanese
martial arts trainings (mostly judo, karate and jujitsu). It is an educational
way which allows everyone (novice to expert) to practice together and improve
themselves in cybersecurity through sparring. It follows budō 武道 (judo, jujitsu,
karate...) principles and moral code similar to them. The goal is to reach
"maximum-efficient use of body, mind and computer" in a "mutual benefit" of a
human confrontation.
