# Principle of cyberjutsu

Cyberjutsu is a Digital Martial Art designed for Sport and Educational Purpose in the Cyberspace. 

It is a physical and mental discipline whose lessons are readily applicable of our daily affairs in the cyberspace. The fundamental principle of cyberjutsu, one that governs all the techniques of attack and defense, is that whatever the objective, it is best attained by the maximum-efficient use of mind and body for that purpose in cyberspace. The same principle applied to our everyday activities leads to the highest and most rational digital life. Training in the techniques of cyberjutsu is not the only way to to grasp this universal principle, but it is how we arrived at an understanding of it, and it is the means by which we attempt to make others understand it. 

 

The principle of maximum efficiency , whether applied to the art of attack and defense or to refining and perfecting daily digital life, demands above all that there be order and harmony among people. This can be realized only through mutual aid and concession. The result is mutual welfare and benefit.  

 

The final aim of cyberjutsu practice is to inculcate respect for the principles of maximum efficiency and mutual welfare and benefit.
