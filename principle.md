# Principle of Cyberjūtsu

Cyberjūtsu is a Digital Martial Art designed for Sport and Educational Purpose in the Cyberspace. 

[WOCSA](http://wocsa.org) started Cyberjūtsu project in 2020 as a new way to bring to people capability to protect themselves and live better in cyberspace.

Cyberjūtsu aims to become an educational method of digital growth, mental growth, and moral growth at the same time.

Cyberjūtsu is a way to train physical and mental discipline whose aim to educate everyone to have a better daily life with computer and internet. The fundamental principle of Cyberjūtsu, one that governs all the techniques of attack and defense, is that whatever the objective, it is best attained by the maximum-efficient use of mind and body for that purpose in cyberspace. To reach this maximum-efficient use we need to practice in a mutual aid. The same principle applied to our everyday activities leads to the highest and most rational digital life. Training in the techniques of Cyberjūtsu is not the only way to  grasp this universal principle, but it is how we arrive at an understanding of it, and it is the means by which we attempt to make others understand it. 

The principle of maximum efficiency , whether applied to the art of attack and defense or to refining and perfecting daily digital life, demands above all that there be order and harmony among people. This can be realized only through mutual aid and concession. The result is mutual welfare and benefit.  

The final aim of Cyberjūtsu practice is to to educate each of us for a better life in the cyberspace. 

>At that time, <b>each man presented his art as a collection of techniques</b>. <b>None  perceived the guiding principle behind</b> jujutsu.
This led me to look for an underlying principle in jujutsu, one that applied when one hit an opponent as well as when one threw him.
I discerned an <b>all-pervasive principle</b>: to <b>make the most efficient use of mental and physical energy</b>.
With this principle in mind, I reviewed all the methods of attack and defense I had learned, retaining only those that were in accordance with this principle.
Those not in accord I rejected,  and in their place I substituted techniques in which the principle was correctly applied.
Judo <b>is more than an art of attack and defense. It is a way of life.</b>
